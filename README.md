At first we load the dataset in excel and then converted the format from xlsx to csv.
After that we load the dataset in mysql

Here we have analysed the pizza sales data by using mysql  and then
 Finally we make a dashboard from the data by using power  bi. We calculated some dax measure to get more insight of the dataset .We have extracted Month Name, Day Name, Month Number, Day Number
 from the order date column so that we can find the trend of our desired values. Moreover we also used power query to formulate the data 

In Dashboard
1. We find the kPI values
2. This is a 2 page dashbaord
3. we have used different types of graphs and charts
4. we used filter at the top of the page
